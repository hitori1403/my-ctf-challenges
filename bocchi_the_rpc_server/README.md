# Bocchi The RPC Server

Bocchi is in the process of learning to create a basic RPC server for her Kessoku Band. She has made some modifications to `rpc.py`. It's important to note that this framework is known to have vulnerabilities. Given Bocchi's timid and introverted nature, she is relying on your expertise to help safeguard the server.
